      <h2>5 Black True Crime Podcasts You Should Know</h2>
      <p>The rise in popularity for true crime is a phenomenon that few understand. 
         Seemingly overnight, many of us, especially women, grew obsessed with true crime. There's something 
         about diving into the twisted and baffling stories that often seem stranger than fiction. 
         And stranger still, according to Ozy, <a href="https://www.ozy.com/good-sht/why-true-crime-is-podcast-crack-for-women/94331/">nearly 75% of true crime podcast listeners are women.</a>
         But one group is missing from the scene: Black people. As a culture, Black people have a unique way of telling stories, turning the simplest
         stories and weaving them into enthralling tales. But rest assured, there are a few podcasts out there!
         
         <br>

         <p>That's why for this Black History Month we wanted to highlight five true crime podcasts
         by Black content creators that you should give a listen!</p>

         This aptly named podcast by sisters Kayla and Kristin takes a different approach on the 
         traditional true crime podcast format. They do it by discussing and shedding light 
         on the lives and crimes committed by Black offenders and their victims.</p>

         What's more rare than a true crime podcast with Black hosts? Try one where 
         Black women are the ones committing the crimes. That's exactly what you'll find on this
         podcast by bffs MaRah and Taz. Follow them as they discuss the crimes and outcomes of Black women,
         including how they are treated differently in the justice system.</p>

      <img src="html-me-something/Affirmative-Murder-Podcast.png" alt="Title card for the Affirmative Murder podcast">
      <p>Amateur true crime lovers Alvin and Fran noticed that there weren't many podcasts that featured
         the perspective of Black 20-something millennial men, and decided to do something about it. Not only
         does their podcast cover minority victims and their perps, but it also does so while diving deep into
         the Black experience and blending gut-aching comedy.</p>

      <p>The murder of his cousin is what sparked Andre's interest in true crime,
         but it was the lack of diversity of voices like him in the true
         crime community that inspired Bruh Issa Murder. Now, together with
         his friends Battle, Kelly, and Robert, they cover true crime cases and serial killers of color 
         while highlighting music from lesser-known artists.</p>

      <p>Tens of thousands of girls and women of color go missing every year, many of whose stories don't
